# TEDxIGDTU
TEDxIGDTU was established in September 2018 by a team of very determined and aspiring students. The team takes pride in promoting diversity of thought and experience in all aspects, and works tirelessly throughout the year to deliver great quality TED talks. This is the website for the event held in January 2019.
